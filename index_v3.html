                        These trips will run from Tuesday 3 December to Friday 6 December. All of these trips will depart from Tawa College at 8:35am and will return by 3:20pm. The total cost of the trips is $75.00 per student. This includes transport and the cost of all activities. Due to the nature of the activities and the fixed costs involve, there will be no refunds given. Students are expected to bring a packed lunch on all of these days as they will not have any opportunities to purchase lunch.

                        Students will not be allowed to participate in these trips if they do not have the correct gear. If you have any difficulty supplying these required items please indicate on the return form and we will endeavour to assist where possible. On all trips students will be expected to abide by the school rules. This includes absolutely no cigarettes, drugs or alcohol. Students will be expected to conduct themselves in a manner that is respectful to both the supervising teachers and other students. Anyone who does not comply with these requirements will be sent back to school and/or home at the expense of their parents/caregivers.

                        It is essential that all students on the trip play their part in risk management. Their personal safety is very much their responsibility and they must always act in a manner that does not endanger either themselves or others. It is important that they follow the instructions of staff at all times.
